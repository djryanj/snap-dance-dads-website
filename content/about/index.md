# Snap Dance Dads

The Snap Dance Dads (SDD) is a group of dads (and whomever else wants to join, [see below](#dads-only)) whose kids dance at [Snap Dance Studios](https://snapdancestudios.com/) in Cochrane, Alberta, Canada. It is an initiative of the Snap Parents' Association started by Ryan Jacobs in 2024. Ryan is also expected to be named Coordinator.

The initiative was begun as a way to encourage the dancers at Snap Dance Studios's dads to become more involved in the incredible sport of dance that their kids pour so much time and energy into.

Being a hockey dad, or a baseball dad, or a soccer dad comes pretty easily to most dads (especially here in Canada), but being a dance dad usually does not; as [The Dancing Dance Mom points out](https://thedancingdancemom.com/the-few-the-proud-the-dance-dads/), "competition dance is (mostly) the realm of women and girls" and "some fathers may just not know what it takes to be an involved dance dad."

# Our Mission

At Snap Dance Dads, we believe that dance families need what dads can bring, and we are here to teach and empower dads to do just that. We believe that the dance dad role shouldn't be limited just to running errands or building props (not that these aren't also important!). Dance dads _can_ do hair, makeup, costumes, and anything else our dancers need, but most of us haven't been shown how. That's where Snap Dance Dads comes in, as we will show you the ins and outs of how to do all of that. Our dancers will appreciate the time and effort we dads put in with them, and knowing that _yes, we can_ is a powerful feeling for us, too.

# Dads Only?

In short: **no**.

While the name of the initative was chosen specifically to encourage dads (who we see as being underrepresented in the world of dance) and much of what we plan to do is focused on teaching skills such as hair and makeup most men don't possess, **we are not exclusively dads-only**. Anyone is welcome to our events: brothers, sisters, moms, dads, grandparents, friends, so long as they are part of their dancers' community of people and agree to abide by our Code of Conduct.
