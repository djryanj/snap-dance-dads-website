Snap Dance Dads is an **inclusive** parent group focused on teaching skills and fostering connections with our dancers who dance at [Snap Dance Studios](https://snapdancestudios.com) in Cochrane, Alberta, Canada. Although we _are_ targeting Dads, **everyone** is welcome.

Please see our [About](/about/) page to learn more.
